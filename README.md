# simple-openai-api-recipe-generator
This Python program takes a list of ingredients and returns a recipe and an image of the dish to the user.

A simple command line application that prompts the user for some ingredients includes those ingredients in a prompt to the OpenAI API,
generates a response, and returns a recipe based on the ingredients available. It also generates an image related to the recipe and saves
it for the user to view.
